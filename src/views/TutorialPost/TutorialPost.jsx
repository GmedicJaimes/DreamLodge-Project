            <p>If your property is a luxurious mansion, consider offering spa treatments, chauffeur services, and gourmet dining experiences. Beachfront properties could offer water sports, beachside barbecues, and sunset yoga sessions.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the step where you'll define the rooms that make up your rental property. Each room contributes to the overall experience your guests will have, so let's make them comfortable, stylish, and inviting!</p>
            <p>Think about the layout of your property. Start with the essentials, like bedrooms, living rooms, and bathrooms. How many of each type of room does your property have? Consider the size and capacity of each room. Is there a master suite with a private balcony? A cozy reading nook in the living area? A spacious dining room for communal meals?</p>
            <p>Remember that each room should reflect the theme and ambiance of your property. Use your style guide to ensure a consistent look and feel throughout. Consider the color palette, furnishings, and decor that will create a cohesive and harmonious environment.</p>
            <p>When describing each room, highlight its unique features. Does the bedroom have a window with a breathtaking view? Does the living room feature a fireplace for cozy evenings? Provide details that will make potential guests excited to experience each space.</p>
            <p>As you select and describe the rooms, think about the needs and preferences of your target audience. Are you catering to families, couples, or groups of friends? Tailor the rooms to provide convenience and comfort for your guests.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the step where you'll determine the price per night for your rental property. Setting the right price is a crucial decision that can attract guests and maximize your revenue. Let's find the sweet spot that reflects the value of your property and meets the expectations of your target audience.</p>
            <p>Consider several factors when deciding on the price. Start by researching similar properties in your area to understand the market rates. Look at properties with similar features, amenities, and location. This will give you an idea of the competitive landscape and help you position your property effectively.</p>
            <p>Think about the unique selling points of your property. Does it offer breathtaking views, luxurious amenities, or convenient access to attractions? These features can justify a higher price point. On the other hand, if you're targeting budget-conscious travelers, a more affordable price might attract more bookings.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind the costs associated with maintaining and managing the property, such as cleaning, maintenance, and utility bills. Factor in these expenses to ensure that your pricing is sustainable and profitable.</p>
            <p>Remember that pricing is not set in stone. You can adjust it over time based on guest feedback, booking patterns, and market trends. Dynamic pricing strategies can also help you optimize your rates based on demand and seasonality.</p>
            <p>It's important to note that our platform will apply a 5% service fee to the price you indicate. This fee helps cover maintenance costs and advertising expenses for the website. Additionally, the earnings from your bookings will be deposited to your account within the first 5 business days of the following month. For example, if you have bookings in August, your total earnings will be processed and deposited to your account within the first 5 business days of September.</p>
            <p>Ready to determine the perfect price for your property? Let's make sure it's competitive, attractive, and aligned with the value you offer to your future guests.</p>
